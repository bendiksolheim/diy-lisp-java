## Part 8: a few final touches

Yay, you've already implemented your language, and even used it to create some code. Well done!

*But wait, there's more!* At least if you want there to be. 

In this last part, we present a few suggestions for improvements and new features you could be adding to the language.

For one thing, the language cannot represent strings. 
And what language with respect for itself doesn't support strings? 
There's also a few common control structures, such as `let` and `cond` we could add, as well as some syntactic sugar for defining functions.

Treat these suggestions as just that -- suggestions. 
At this point the language is yours, and if you want something completely different, then that's perfectly fine.


```bash
mvn -P part8 test
